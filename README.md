# Store and Inventory Control System
The Inventory Management System is a real-time inventory database capable of connecting multiple stores.  This can be used to track the inventory of a single store, or to manage the delivery of stock between several branches of a larger franchise.

However, the system merely records sales and restocking data and provides warning of low stock at any location through email at a specified interval.  The goal is to reduce the stress of tracking rather than to holder all store maintenance.

Further features may consist of the ability to create reports of sales, but again the explanation is left to the management.  In addition, since theft does occasionally occur, the system provides solutions for confirming the store inventory and for correcting stock quantities.
